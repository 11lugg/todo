This project used React JS and is hosted and authenticated using firebase.

This project was an opportunity for me to consolidate my React JS experience. I created containers and components and passed down props. I also taken the opportunity to learn how to host and add authentication and databases through firebase. 

#Dream
I would like to make the page more dynamic. You as a user can add a new list when you want one. I want to further style this project so that it looks more appealing to the user.
